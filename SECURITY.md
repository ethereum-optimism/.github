# Security Policy

## How to disclose a vulnerability to us

### The wrong way to disclose

The following actions will disqualify you from eligibility for a reward:

1. Filing a public ticket mentioning the vulnerability
2. Testing the vulnerability on the mainnet or testnet

#### The right way to disclose

### Smart contract and infrastructure vulnerabilities

We have a bounty program with a maximum payout of $2,000,042. Please see [our bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/) at Immunefi for more details.

### Other vulnerabilities

For vulnerabilities in any of our websites, email servers or other non-critical infrastructure, please email OP Labs at [security@oplabs.co](mailto:security@oplabs.co). We and Labs appreciate detailed instructions for confirming the vulnerability.


## How we disclose vulnerabilities

In the event that we learn of a critical security vulnerability, we reserve the right to
silently fix it without immediately publicly disclosing the existence of nature of the vulnerability.

In such a scenario we will:

1. silently fix a vulnerability and include the fix in release X,
2. after 4-8 weeks, we will disclose that X contained a security-fix,
3. after an additional 4-8 weeks, we will publish details of the vulnerability along with credit to the reporter (with express permission from the reporter).

Alongside this policy, we also reserve the right to do either of the following:
- bypass this policy and publish details on a shorter timeline
- to directly notify a subset of downstream users prior to making a public announcement

This policy is based the Geth team’s [silent patch policy](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/geth-developer/disclosures#why-silent-patches).

### Defensive measures during an incident

Our system does not currently have fault proofs, meaning we are able to pause the system in an
emergency.

We've established some guiding criteria for disabling the system during an incident response
situation:

- If an attack is ongoing: we should disable or pause in order to prevent further damage.
- If we suspect that a vulnerability might be widely known: we should disable or pause proactively.
- Otherwise: we should not disable or pause the system.
